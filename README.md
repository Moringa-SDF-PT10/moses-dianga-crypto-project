# moses-dianga-crypto-project - Crypto Guess Challenge

Project Summary

The Crypto Guess Challenge is an interactive single-page application (SPA) where players guess cryptocurrency names based on hints like symbol, rank, price, market cap, first letter, and launch year. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses the CoinPaprika API for real-time data. The game features three rounds, instant feedback, a final score, and a restart option. Developed for the Moringa School SDF-PT10 Phase 1 Final Project, it showcases asynchronous API integration, event listeners, and GitHub Pages deployment.

How to Play

# View hints for a mystery cryptocurrency (e.g., Symbol: BTC, Rank: 1).
# Type your guess and click "Guess" or press Enter.
# See feedback: "Correct " or "Wrong  It was [Coin Name]".
# Click "Next Round" to continue (3 rounds total).
# Check your score and coin names at the end.
# Click "Play Again" to restart.
